        <h2>Both of the Video Game and Tabletop Variety</h2>

            <p>There are many games I like to play with my wife and with my friends.</p>
           <p>My wife likes to mostly play <a href="boardgames.html">board games</a> and roleplaying games. It is important to have friends for this endeavour because two player games of this variety get boring quickly.</p>
            <p>Many of my friends like to play war and skirmish games, but my wife does not. It is therefore important to have at least one friend in this endeavour. Two players are perfect for this format.</p>
            <p>I like to play video games by myself, but I also have a wife and a daughter who enjoy playing video games with me from time to time. That's okay if I don't feel I'm being hampered by their noobishness.</p>
